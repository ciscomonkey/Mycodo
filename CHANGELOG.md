## 7.0.0 (2018-12-08)

The Mycodo 7.0 introduces many redesigned systems, including measurements/units, conversions, conditionals, and more (see full list, below). The remnants of Conditionals have been moved to a new controller, called Triggers, which executes actions in response to event triggers (such as time-based events, Output changes, sunrises/sunsets, etc.). The new Conditional system incorporates a powerful way of developing complex conditional statements. See ([#493](https://github.com/kizniche/mycodo/issues/493)) for more information. Since earlier versions are not compatible with 7.x, all 6.x users will have to perform a fresh install or delete their settings database. An option will be presented on the upgrade page to delete the database and perform an upgrade.

## 5.5.0 (2017-12-25)

Merry Christmas!

With the release of 5.5.0, Mycodo becomes modern by migrating from Python 2.7.9 to Python 3 (3.5.3 if on Raspbian Stretch, 3.4.2 if on Raspbian Jessie). This release also brings a big switch from apache2+mod_wsgi to nginx+gunicorn as the web server.

### Issues

***You may experience an error during the upgrade that doesn't allow it to complete***

***It will no longer be possible to restore pre-5.5.0 backups***

***All users will be logged out of the web UI during the upgrade***

***All Conditionals will be deactivated and need reconfiguring***

***OpenCV has been removed as a camera module***

If you rely on your system to work, it is highly recommended that you ***DO NOT UPGRADE***. Wait until your system is no longer performing critical tasks to upgrade, in order to allow yourself the ability to thoroughly test your particular configuration works as expected, and top perform a fresh install if the upgrade fails. Although most parts of the system have been tested to work, there is, as always, the potential for unforeseen issues (for instance, not every sensor that Mycodo supports has physically been tested). Read the following notes carefully to determine if you want to upgrade to 5.5.0 and newer versions.

#### Failure during the upgrade to >= 5.5.0

I found that occasionally the upgrade will spontaneously stop without an indication of the issue. I've seen it happen during an apt-get install and during a pip upgrade. It does not seem consistent, and there were no erorrs, therefore it wasn't able to be fixed. If you experience an error during the upgrade that doesn't allow the upgrade to complete, issue the following commands to attempt to resume and complete the upgrade. If that doesn't fix it, you may have to install Mycodo from scratch.

```bash
sudo dpkg --configure -a
sudo /bin/bash ~/Mycodo/mycodo/scripts/upgrade_post.sh
```

#### No restoring of pre-5.5.0 backups

Restoring pre-5.5.0 backups will not work. This is due to the moving of the pip virtual environments during the restore, the post-5.5.0 (python3) virtualenv not being compatible with the pre-5.5.0 virtualenv (python2), and moving from the apache2 web server to nginx. If you absolutely need to restore a backup, it must be done manually. Create a new github issue to get asistance with this.

Also with this release, exporting and importing both the Mycodo settings database and InfluxDB measurement database has been added. These may be imported back into Mycodo at a later timer. Currently, the InfluxDB (measurement) database may be imported into any other version of Mycodo, and the Mycodo (settings) database may only be imported to the same version of Mycodo. Automatic upgrading or downgrading of the Mycodo database to allow cross-version compatibility will be included in a future release. For the meantime, if you need to restore Mycodo settings to a particular Mycodo version, you can do the following: download the tar.gz of the particular [Mycodo Release](https://github.com/kizniche/Mycodo/releases) compatible with your database backup, extract, install normally, import the Mycodo settings database, then perform an upgrade of Mycodo to the latest release.

#### All users will be logged out during the upgrade

Another consequence of changing from Python 2 to 3 is current browser cookies will cause an error with the web user interface. Therefore, all users will be logged out after upgrading to >= 5.5.0. This will cause some strange behavior that may be misconstrued as a failed upgrade:
 
 1. The upgrade log will not update during the upgrade. Give the upgrade ample time to finish, or monitor the upgrade log from the command line.
 
 2. After the upgrade is successful, the upgrade log box on the Upgrade page will redirect to the login page. Do not log in through the log box, but rather refresh the entire page to be redirected to the login page.

#### All Conditionals will be deactivated

The Conditional code has been refactored to make them more modular. Because some conditionals will need to be reconfigured before they will operate corectly, all conditionals have been deactivated. Therefore, after the upgrade, reconfigure them appropriately, then reactivate. Additionally, conditionals (for all controllers) have been moved to a new 'Function' page.

#### OpenCV has been disabled

A Python 3 compatible binary version of opencv, whoch doesn't require an extremely long (hours) compiling process, is unfortunately unavailable. Therefore, if you know of a library or module that can successfully acquire an image from your webcam (you have tested to work), create a [new issue](https://github.com/kizniche/Mycodo/issues/new) with the details of how you acquired the image and we can determine if the method can be integrated into Mycddo.

## 4.1.9 (2017-01-27)

This update fixes two major bugs: Sometimes admin users not being created properly from the web UI and the daemon not being set to automatically start during install.

This update also fixes an even more severe bug affecting the database upgrade system. If you installed a system before this upgrade, you are probably affected. This release will display a message indicating if your database has an issue. Deleting ~/Mycodo/databases/mycodo.db and restarting the web server (or reboot) will regenerate the database.

If your daemon doesn't automatically start because you installed it with a botched previous version, issue the following commands to add it to systemctl's autostart:

***Important***: Make sure you rename 'user' below to your actual user where you installed Mycodo, and make sure the Mycodo install directory is correct and points to the correct mycodo.service file.

```
sudo service mycodo stop
sudo systemctl disable mycodo.service
sudo rm -rf /etc/systemd/system/mycodo.service
sudo systemctl enable /home/user/Mycodo/install/mycodo.service
sudo service mycodo start
```

### Features

  - Add check for problematic database and notify user how to fix it

### Miscellaneous

  - Remove Sensor Logs (Tools/Sensor Logs). The addition of the measurement export feature in this release deprecates Sensor Logs. Note that by the very nature of how the Sensor Log controllers were designed, there was a high probability of missing measurements. The new measurement export feature ensures all measurements are exported.
