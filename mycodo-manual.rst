About Mycodo
============

Mycodo is an automated monitoring and regulation system that was built
to run on the `Raspberry Pi <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raspberry_Pi>`__
(versions Zero, 1, 2, and 3).

Originally developed for cultivating edible mushrooms, Mycodo has grown
to do much more, including growing plants, culturing microorganisms,
maintaining animal environments (laboratory honey bee apiary, young
mammal and snake egg incubation, aquariums, herptariums), fermenting and
curing tobacco, fermenting and aging foods (beer, cheese, tempeh), cooking
food (sous-vide), and more.

The system comprises a backend (daemon) and a frontend (web server).
The backend acquires measurements from sensors and devices, and
coordinates a diverse set of responses to those measurements, including
the ability to modulate outputs (relays, PWM, wireless outlets),
regulate environmental conditions with electrical devices under PID
control (steady regulation or changing over time), schedule timers,
capture photos and stream video, trigger actions when measurements meet
certain conditions (modulate relays, execute commands, notify by email,
etc.), and more. The frontend is a web interface that enables easy
navigation and configuration from any browser-enabled device.

Brief Overview
==============

There are a number of different uses for Mycodo. Some users simply store
sensor measurements to monitor conditions remotely, others regulate the
environmental conditions of a physical space, while others capture
motion-activated or timelapse photography, and more.

Input controllers acquire measurements and store them in a
`time series database <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_series_database>`__.
Measurements typically come from sensors, but may also be configured to
use the return value of linux or Python commands, or math equations,
making a very powerful system for acquiring and generating data.

Output controllers produce changes to the general input/output (GPIO)
pins or may be configured to execute linux or Python commands, enabling
a large number of potential uses. There are a few different types of
outputs: simple switching of pins (HIGH/LOW), generating pulse-width
modulated (PWM) signals, switching 315/433 MHz wireless outlets, as well as
executing linux and Python commands. The most common output is using a relay
to switch electrical devices on and off.

When Inputs and Outputs are combined, PID controllers may be used to
create a feedback loop that uses the Output device to modulate an
environmental condition the Input measures. Certain Inputs may be coupled
with certain Outputs to create a variety of different control and
regulation applications. Beyond simple regulation, Methods may be used
to create changing setpoints over time, enabling such things as thermal
cyclers, reflow ovens, environmental simulation for terrariums, food and
beverage fermentation or curing, and cooking food
(`sous-vide <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sous-vide>`__), to name a
few.

Triggers can be set to activate events based on specific dates and times or
according to durations of time. Conditionals are used to activates certain
events based on the truth of custom user statements (e.g. "Sensor1 > 23 and 10
< Sensor2 < 30").

Frequently Asked Questions
==========================

*What should I do if I have an issue?*

First, read though this manual to make sure you understand how the
system works and you're using the system properly. Also check out the
`Mycodo Wiki <https://github.com/kizniche/Mycodo/wiki>`__. You may even
want to look through recent `GitHub
Issues <https://github.com/kizniche/Mycodo/issues>`__. If you haven't
resolved your issue by this point, make a `New GitHub
Issue <https://github.com/kizniche/Mycodo/issues/new>`__ describing the
issue and attaching a sufficient amount of evidence (screenshots, log
files, etc.) to aid in diagnosing the issue.

--------------

*How do I add an Input (like a sensor) to the system if it's not
currently supported?*

Currently, adding an Input device that's not currently supported can be
achieved by two different methods:

The first involves editing several internal Mycodo files. There has been
effort to make the addition process as simple as possible. See the
`Adding Support for a New Input <https://github.com/kizniche/Mycodo/wiki/Adding-Support-for-a-New-Input>`__
Wiki page for how to do this. All changes will be lost during an
upgrade, therefore it is suggested to make a GitHub pull request with
your changes to permanently integrate them into Mycodo.

The second way to add an Input is to create a script that obtains and
returns a numerical value when executed in the linux system of the
Raspberry Pi. This script may be configured to be executed by a "Linux
Command" Input type. This will periodically execute the command and
store the returned value to the database for use with the rest of the
Mycodo system.

--------------

*How do I set up simple regulation?*

Here is how I generally set up Mycodo to monitor and regulate:

1. Determine what environmental condition you want to measure or
   regulate. Consider the devices that must be coupled to achieve this.
   For instance, temperature regulation require a temperature sensor as
   the input and an electric heater (or cooler) as the output.
2. Determine what relays you will need to power your electric devices.
   The Raspberry Pi is capable of directly switching relays (using a
   3.3-volt signal). Remember to select a relay that can handle the load
   and doesn't exceed the maximum current draw from the Raspberry Pi
   GPIO pins.
3. See the `Device Specific Information <#device-specific-information>`__ for information about
   what sensors are supported. Acquire sensor(s) and relay(s) and
   connect them to the Raspberry Pi according to the manufacturerâ€™s
   instructions.
4. On the ``Setup -> Data`` page, create a new input using the drop-down to select
   the correct sensor or input device. Configure the input with the
   correct communication pins and other options. Activate the input to
   begin recording measurements to the database.
5. Go to the ``Live`` page to ensure there is
   recent data being acquired from the input.
6. On the ``Setup -> Output`` page, add a relay and configure the GPIO pin that
   switches it, whether the relay switches On when the signal is HIGH or
   LOW, and what state (On or Off) to set the relay when Mycodo starts.
   A pulse-width modulated (PWM) output may also be used, among others.
7. Test the relay by switching it On and Off or generating a PWM signal
   from the ``Setup -> Output`` page and make sure the device connected to the
   relay turns On when you select "On", and Off when you select "Off".
8. On the ``Setup -> Function`` page, create a PID controller with the
   appropriate input, output, and other parameters. Activate the PID
   controller.
9. On the ``Dash`` page, create a graph that includes
   the input measurement, the output that is being used by the PID, and
   the PID output and setpoint. This provides a good visualization for
   tuning the PID. See `Quick Setup Examples <#quick-setup-examples>`__
   for a greater detail of this process and tuning tips.

*Can I communicate with Mycodo from the command line?*

Yes, ~/Mycodo/mycodo/mycodo\_client.py has this functionality, but
there's a lot to be desired. Below may not be the most current list of
commands, so it's recommended to execute the installed symlink
``mycodo-client --help`` to see a full list with descriptions.

--------------

*Can I variably-control the speed of motors or other devices with the
PWM output signal from the PID?*

Yes, as long as you have the proper hardware to do that. The PWM signal
being produced by the PID should be handled appropriately, whether by a
fast-switching solid state relay, an
`AC modulation circuit <#schematics-for-ac-modulation>`__,
`DC modulation circuit <#schematics-for-dc-fan-control>`__, or something else.

--------------

*I have a PID controller that uses one temperature sensor. If this sensor stops working, my entire PID controller stops working. Is there a way to prevent this by setting up a second sensor to be used in case the first one fails?*

Yes, you can use as many sensors as you would like to create a redundant system so your PID doesn't stop working if one or more sensors fail. To do this, follow the below instructions:

1. Add and activate all your sensors. For this example, we will use three temperature sensors, Sensor1, Sensor2, and Sensor3, that return measurements in degrees Celsius.
2. Go to the ``Setup -> Data`` page and add the Math controller "Redundancy".
3. In the options of the Redundancy controller, set the Period, Start Offset, and Max Age.
4. In the options of the Redundancy controller, select Sensor1, Sensor2, and Sensor3 for the Input option and click Save.
5. In the options of the Redundancy controller, change the order you wish to use the sensors under Order of Use. For this example, we will use the default order (Sensor1, Sensor2, Sensor3).
6. In the options of the Redundancy controller, under Measurement Settings, select Celsius for the Measurement Unit and click Save under Measurement Settings.
7. Activate the Redundancy Math controller.
8. Go to the Live page and verify the Redundancy Math controller is working correctly by returning a value from one of the three selected Inputs. If the first sensor is working correctly, it should return this value. You can deactivate the first sensor (mimicking the first sensor stopped working) and see if the second sensor's value is then returned.
9. Go to the ``Setup -> Function`` page and select the new Redundancy Math controller for the PID Measurement option.

The PID controller will now use the measurement returned from the Redundancy Math controller, which in turn will acquire its measurement in the following way:

If a measurement can be found within the Max Age for Sensor1, the measurement for Sensor1 will be returned. If a measurement from Sensor1 could not be acquired, and if a measurement can be found within the Max Age for Sensor2, the measurement for Sensor2 will be returned. If a measurement from Sensor2 could not be acquired, and if a measurement can be found within the Max Age for Sensor3, the measurement for Sensor3 will be returned. If a measurement from Sensor3 could not be acquired, then the Redundancy Math controller will not return a measurement at all (indicating all three sensors are not working). It is advised to set up a Conditional to send a notification email to yourself if one or more measurements are unable to be acquired.

Data
----

``Setup -> Data``

Data are individual pieces of information stored for later use. They may
be values acquired from sensors, signals from analog-to-digital controllers,
a response from a command, or even math performed on other data to produce
an average, to name a few. Add, configure, and activate Inputs to begin
recording measurements to the database and allow them to be used throughout
Mycodo.

Input
`````

Inputs, such as sensors, ADC signals, or even a response from a command,
enable measuring conditions in the environment or elsewhere, which will
be stored in a time-series database (InfluxDB). This database will provide
measurements for `Graphs <#graphs>`__, `LCDs <#lcds>`__,
`PID Controllers <#pid-controllers>`__,
`Conditional Statements <#conditional-statements>`__, and other parts of
Mycodo to operate from. Add, configure, and activate inputs to begin
recording measurements to the database and allow them to be used throughout
Mycodo.

In addition to several supported sensors and devices, a Linux command
may be specified that will be executed and the return value stored in
the measurement database to be used throughout the Mycodo system.

|                       | when in-line with a circuit supplying a         |
|                       | 3.3-volt input signal to a GPIO, such as simple |
|                       | mechanical switch, a button, a magnet           |
|                       | (reed/hall) sensor, a PIR motion detector, and  |
|                       | more.                                           |

| Bounce Time (ms)      | Edge sensors only: This is the number of        |
|                       | milliseconds to bounce the input signal. This   |
|                       | is commonly called debouncing a signal [1]      |
|                       | and may be necessary if using a mechanical      |
|                       | circuit.                                        |
+-----------------------+-------------------------------------------------+
| Reset Period          | Edge sensors only: This is the period of time   |
| (seconds)             | after an edge detection that another edge will  |
|                       | not be recorded. This enables devices such as   |
|                       | PIR motion sensors that may stay activated for  |
|                       | longer periods of time.                         |
+-----------------------+-------------------------------------------------+
| Measurement           | Analog-to-digital converter only: The type of   |
|                       | measurement being acquired by the ADC. For      |
|                       | instance, if the resistance of a photocell is   |
|                       | being measured through a voltage divider, this  |
|                       | measurement would be "light".                   |
+-----------------------+-------------------------------------------------+
| Units                 | Analog-to-digital converter only: This is the   |
|                       | unit of the measurement. With the above example |
|                       | of "light" as the measurement, the unit may be  |
|                       | "lux" or "intensity".                           |

| Resistor Reference    | If your reference resistor is not the default   |
| (Ohm)                 | (400 Ohm for PT100, 4000 Ohm for PT1000), you   |
|                       | can manually set this value. Several            |
|                       | manufacturers now use 430 Ohm resistors on      |
|                       | their circuit boards, therefore it's            |
|                       | recommended to verify the accuracy of your      |
|                       | measurements and adjust this value if           |
|                       | necessary.                                      |

| Channel               | Analog-to-digital converter only: This is the   |
|                       | channel to obtain the voltage measurement from  |
|                       | the ADC.                                        |
+-----------------------+-------------------------------------------------+
| Gain                  | Analog-to-digital converter only: set the gain  |
|                       | when acquiring the measurement.                 |
+-----------------------+-------------------------------------------------+
| Sample Speed          | Analog-to-digital converter only: set the       |
|                       | sample speed (typically samples per second).    |
+-----------------------+-------------------------------------------------+
| Volts Min             | Analog-to-digital converter only: What is the   |
|                       | minimum voltage to use when scaling to produce  |
|                       | the unit value for the database. For instance,  |
|                       | if your ADC is not expected to measure below    |
|                       | 0.2 volts for your particular circuit, set this |
|                       | to "0.2".                                       |
+-----------------------+-------------------------------------------------+
| Volts Max             | Analog-to-digital converter only: This is       |
|                       | similar to the Min option above, however it is  |
|                       | setting the ceiling to the voltage range. Units |
|                       | Min Analog-to-digital converter only: This      |
|                       | value will be the lower value of a range that   |
|                       | will use the Min and Max Voltages, above, to    |
|                       | produce a unit output. For instance, if your    |
|                       | voltage range is 0.0 - 1.0 volts, and the unit  |
|                       | range is 1 - 60, and a voltage of 0.5 is        |
|                       | measured, in addition to 0.5 being stored in    |
|                       | the database, 30 will be stored as well. This   |
|                       | enables creating calibrated scales to use with  |
|                       | your particular circuit.                        |
+-----------------------+-------------------------------------------------+
| Units Max             | Analog-to-digital converter only: This is       |
|                       | similar to the Min option above, however it is  |
|                       | setting the ceiling to the unit range.          |

| Weighting             | The This is a number between 0 and 1 and        |
|                       | indicates how much the old reading affects the  |
|                       | new reading. It defaults to 0 which means the   |
|                       | old reading has no effect. This may be used to  |
|                       | smooth the data.                                |

|                       | input).                                         |
+-----------------------+-------------------------------------------------+
| Times to Check        | The number of times to attempt to ping a server |
|                       | (Server Ping input).                            |
+-----------------------+-------------------------------------------------+
| Deadline (seconds)    | The maximum amount of time to wait for each     |
|                       | ping attempt, after which 0 (offline) will be   |
|                       | returned (Server Ping input).                   |

+---------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------+
| Difference                      | Stores the mathematical difference (value\_1 -  |
|                                 | value\_2).                                      |

|                                 | available, the next measurement will be used.   |
|                                 | For example, this is useful if an Input stops   |
|                                 | but you don't want a PID controller to stop     |
|                                 | working if there is another measurement that    |
|                                 | can be used. More than one Input can be         |

|                       | temperature. A list of the pre-defined          |
|                       | measurements that may be used is below.         |
+-----------------------+-------------------------------------------------+
| Units                 | This is the units to display along with the     |

|                       | the units associated with that measurement.     |
+-----------------------+-------------------------------------------------+
| Reverse Equation      | For Difference calculations, this will reverse  |

|                       | to ``value_2 - value_1``.                       |
+-----------------------+-------------------------------------------------+
| Absolute Value        | For Difference calculations, this will yield an |

+-----------------------+-------------------------------------------------+
| Max Difference        | If the difference between any selected Input is |
|                       | greater than this value, no new value will be   |
|                       | stored in the database.                         |

|                       | temperature measurements)                       |
+-----------------------+-------------------------------------------------+
| Wet-Bulb Temperature  | The measurement that will serve as the wet-bulb |
|                       | temperature (this is the colder of the two      |
|                       | temperature measurements)                       |
+-----------------------+-------------------------------------------------+
| Pressure              | This is an optional pressure measurement that   |
|                       | can be used to calculate the percent relative   |
|                       | humidity. If disabled, a default 101325 Pa will |
|                       | be used in the calculation.                     |
+-----------------------+-------------------------------------------------+

``Setup -> Output``

Outputs are various signals that can be generated that operate devices.
An output can be a PWM signal, a simple HIGH/LOW signal to operate a
relay, a 315/433 MHz signal to switch a radio frequency-operated relay,
driving of pumps and motors, or an execution of a linux or Python command,
to name a few.

PWM
```

Pulse-width modulation (PWM) is a modulation technique used to encode a
message into a pulsing signal, at a specific frequency in Hertz (Hz).
The average value of voltage (and current) fed to the load is controlled
by turning the switch between supply and load on and off at a fast rate.
The longer the switch is on compared to the off periods, the higher the
total power supplied to the load.

The PWM switching frequency has to be much higher than what would affect
the load (the device that uses the power), which is to say that the
resultant waveform perceived by the load must be as smooth as possible.
The rate (or frequency) at which the power supply must switch can vary
greatly depending on load and application, for example

    Switching has to be done several times a minute in an electric
    stove; 120 Hz in a lamp dimmer; between a few kilohertz (kHz) to
    tens of kHz for a motor drive; and well into the tens or hundreds of
    kHz in audio amplifiers and computer power supplies.

The term duty cycle describes the proportion of 'on' time to the regular
interval or 'period' of time; a low duty cycle corresponds to low power,
because the power is off for most of the time. Duty cycle is expressed
in percent, 100% being fully on.

PWM pins can be set up on the ``Setup -> Output``` page, then it may be used by a PWM
PID Controller.

When using non-hardware PWM pins, there are only certain frequencies
that can be used. These frequencies in Hertz are 40000, 20000, 10000,
8000, 5000, 4000, 2500, 2000, 1600, 1250, 1000, 800, 500, 400, 250, 200,

Relays
``````

Relays are electromechanical or solid-state devices that enable a small
voltage signal (such as from a microprocessor) to activate a much larger
voltage, without exposing the low-voltage system to the dangers of the
higher voltage.

Add and configure outputs in the Output tab. Outputs must be properly
set up before PID regulation can be achieved.

Wired
'''''

To set up a wired relay, set the "GPIO Pin" to the BCM GPIO number of
each pin that activates each relay. *On Trigger* should be set to the
signal that activates the relay (the device attached to the relay turns
on). If your relay activates when the potential across the coil is
0-volts, set *On Trigger* to "Low", otherwise if your relay activates
when the potential across the coil is 3.3-volts (or whatever switching
voltage you are using, if not being driven by the GPIO pin), set it to
"High".

Wireless
''''''''

Certain 315/433 MHz wireless relays may be used, however you will need to
set the pin of the transmitter (using BCM numbering), pulse length,
bit length, protocol, on command, and off command. To determine your On
and Off commands, connect a 315/433 MHz receiver to your Pi, then run the
receiver script, below, replacing 17 with the pin your receiver is
connected to (using BCM numbering), and press one of the buttons on your
remote (either on or off) to detect the numeric code associated with that button.

::

    sudo ~/Mycodo/env/bin/python ~/Mycodo/mycodo/devices/wireless_rpi_rf.py -d 2 -g 17

433 MHz wireless relays have been successfully tested with SMAKN 433MHz
RF Transmitters/Receivers and Etekcity Wireless Remote Control
Electrical Outlets (see
`Issue 88 <https://github.com/kizniche/Mycodo/issues/88>`__ for more
information). If you have a 315/433 MHz transmitter/receiver and a wireless
relay that does not work with the current code, submit a
`new issue <https://github.com/kizniche/Mycodo/issues/new>`__ with details of
your hardware.

Command
'''''''

Another option for output control is to execute a terminal command when
the output is turned on, off, or a duty cycle. Commands will be executed
as the user 'root'.

Wireless and Command Output Note: Since the wireless protocol only
allows 1-way communication to 315/433 MHz devices, wireless relays are
assumed to be off until they are turned on, and therefore will appear
red (off) when added. If a wireless relay is turned off or on outside
Mycodo (by a remote, for instance), Mycodo will ***not*** be able to
determine the state of the relay and will indicate whichever state the
relay was last. This is, if Mycodo turns the wireless relay on, and a
remote is used to turn the relay off, Mycodo will still assume the relay
is on.

Pumps
`````

Currently, only one pump is supported, the `Atlas Scientific EZO-PMP peristaltic pump <#atlas-scientific-ezo-pmp>`__.

Function
--------

``Setup -> Function``

Functions couple Inputs with Outputs to perform specific tasks. For
example, this could be regulation of temperature with a temperature
sensor and heater with a PID Controller.

PID Controller
``````````````

A
`proportional-derivative-integral (PID) controller <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PID_controller>`__
is a control loop feedback mechanism used throughout industry for controlling
systems. It efficiently brings a measurable condition, such as the
temperature, to a desired state and maintains it there with little
overshoot and oscillation. A well-tuned PID controller will raise to the
setpoint quickly, have minimal overshoot, and maintain the setpoint with
little oscillation.

PID settings may be changed while the PID is activated and the new
settings will take effect immediately. If settings are changed while the
controller is paused, the values will be used once the controller
resumes operation.

| Direction             | This is the direction that you wish to          |

|                       | if you require regulation up and down, set this |
|                       | to "Both."                                      |

PID Autotune
''''''''''''

The Autotune feature is useful for determining appropriate Kp, Ki, and Kd
gains of a PID controller. The autotuner will manipulate an output and measure the response in
the environment being measured by a sensor. It will take several cycles
to determine the gains according to several rules. In order to use this
feature, the PID controller must be properly configured, and a Noise Band
and Outstep selected, then select "Start Autotune". The output of the
autotuner will appear in the daemon log (Config -> Mycodo Logs -> Daemon).
While the autotune is being performed, it is recommended to create a graph
that includes the Input, Output, and PID Setpoint/Output in order to see
what the PID Autotuner is doing and to notice any issues. If your autotune
is taking a long time to complete, there may not be enough stability in
the system being manipulated to calculate a reliable set of PID gains.
This may be because there are too many disturbances to the system, or
conditions are changing too rapidly to acquire consistent measurement
oscillations. If this is the case, try modifying your system to reduce
disturbances. Once the autotune successfully completes, disturbances may
be reintroduced in order to further tune the PID controller to handle them.

+-----------------------+-------------------------------------------------+
| Setting               | Description                                     |
+=======================+=================================================+
| Noise Band            | This is the amount above the setpoint the       |
|                       | measured condition must reach before the output |
|                       | turns off. This is also how much below the      |
|                       | setpoint the measured condition must fall       |
|                       | before the output turns back on.                |
+-----------------------+-------------------------------------------------+
| Outstep               | This is how many seconds the output will turn   |
|                       | on every PID Period. For instance, to autotune  |
|                       | with 50% power, ensure the Outstep is half the  |
|                       | value of the PID Period.                        |
+-----------------------+-------------------------------------------------+

Typical graph output will look like this:

Conditional
```````````

Conditional controllers are used to perform certain actions based on whether a
conditional statement is true, which is typically based on a measurement or GPIO
state.

Conditional Setup Guide
'''''''''''''''''''''''

Python 3 is the environment that these conditionals will be executed. The
following

+-----------------------+-------------------------------------------------+
| Function              | Description                                     |
+=======================+=================================================+
| measure("{ID}")       | Returns a measurement for the Condition with ID.|
+-----------------------+-------------------------------------------------+
| run_action("{ID}")    | Executes the Action with ID.                    |
+-----------------------+-------------------------------------------------+
| run_all_actions()     | Executes all actions.                           |
+-----------------------+-------------------------------------------------+

Since the Python code contained in the Conditional Statement must be formatted
properly, it's best to familiarize yourself with the
`basics of Python <https://realpython.com/python-conditional-statements/>`__.

Note that there are two different IDs in use here, one set of IDs are for the
measurements, under the ``Conditions`` section of the Conditional, and one set
of IDs are for the Actions, under the ``Actions`` section of the Conditional.
Read all of this section, including the examples, below, to fully understand how
to configure a conditional properly.

IMPORTANT: If a measurement hasn't been acquired within the Max Age that is set,
"None" will be returned when measure("{ID}") is called in the code. It is very
important that you account for this. All examples below incorporate a test for
the measurement being None, and this should not be removed. If an error occurs
(such as if the statement resolves to comparing None to a numerical value, such
as "if None < 23"), then the code will stop there and an error will be logged
in the daemon log. Accounting for None is useful for determining if an Input is
no longer acquiring measurements (e.g. dead sensor, malfunction, etc.).

To create a basic conditional, follow these steps, using the numbers in the
screenshots, below, that correspond to the numbers in parentheses:

- Navigate to the ``Setup -> Function`` page.
- Select "Controller: Conditional", then click ``Add``.
- Under Conditions (1), select a condition option, then click ``Add Condition``.
- Configure the newly-added Condition then click ``Save``.
- Under Actions (2), select an action option, then click ``Add Action``.
- Configure the newly-added Action then click ``Save``.
- Notice that each Condition and each Action has its own ID (underlined).
- The default Conditional Statement (3) contains placeholder IDs that need to be changed to your Condition and Action IDs. Change the ID in measure("{asdf1234}") to your Condition ID. Change the ID in run_action("{qwer5678}", message=message) to your Action ID. Click ``Save`` at the top of the Conditional.
- The logic used in the Conditional Statement will need to be adjusted to suit your particular needs. Additionally, you may add more Conditions or Actions. See the ``Advanced Conditional Statement examples``, below, for usage examples.

If your ``Conditional Statement`` has been formatted correctly, your
Conditional will save and it will be ready to activate. If an error is returned,
your options will not have been saved. Inspect the error for which line is
causing the issue and read the error message itself to try to understand what
the problem is and how to fix it. There are an unfathomable number of ways to
configure a Conditional, but this should hopefully get you started to developing
one that suits your needs.

Note: Mycodo is constantly changing, so the screenshots below may not match what
you see exactly. Be sure to read this entire section of the manual to understand
how to use Conditionals.

Simple ``Conditional Statement`` examples:

Each measure("{ID}") will return the most recent measurement obtained from that
particular measurement under the ``Conditions`` section of the Conditional, as
long as it's within the set Max Age.

::

    # Example 1, no measurement, useful to notify by email when an Input stops working
    if measure("{asdf1234}") is None:
        run_all_actions()

    # Example 2, test two measurements
    measure_1 = measure("{asdf1234}")
    measure_2 = measure("{hjkl5678}")
    if None not in [measure_1, measure_2]:
        if measure_1 < 20 and measure_2 > 10:
            run_all_actions()

    # Example 3, test two measurements and sum of measurements
    measure_1 = measure("{asdf1234}")
    measure_2 = measure("{hjkl5678}")
    if None not in [measure_1, measure_2]:
        sum = measure_1 + measure_2
        if measure_1 > 2 and 10 < measure_2 < 23 and sum < 30.5:
            run_all_actions()

    # Example 4, combine into one conditional
    measurement = measure("{asdf1234}")
    if measurement != None and 20 < measurement < 30:
        run_all_actions()

    # Example 5, test two measurements and convert Edge Input from 0 or 1 to True or False
    measure_1 = measure("{asdf1234}")
    measure_2 = measure("{hjkl5678}")
    if None not in [measure_1, measure_2]:
        if bool(measure_1) and measure_2 > 10:
            run_all_actions()

    # Example 6, test measurement with "or" and a rounded measurement
    measure_1 = measure("{asdf1234}")
    measure_2 = measure("{hjkl5678}")
    if None not in [measure_1, measure_2]:
        if measure_1 > 20 or int(round(measure_2)) in [20, 21, 22]:
            run_all_actions()


Advanced ``Conditional Statement`` examples:

These examples expand on the simple examples, above, by activating specific
actions. The following examples will reference actions with IDs that can be
found under the ``Actions`` section of the Conditional. Two example action
ID will be used: "qwer1234" and "uiop5678". Additionally, run_all_actions()
is used here, which will run all actions in the order in which they appear
in the Actions section of the Conditional.

::

    # Example 1
    measurement = measure("{asdf1234}")
    if measurement is None:
        run_action("{qwer1234}")
    elif measurement > 23:
        run_action("{uiop5678}")
    else:
        run_all_actions()

    # Example 2, test two measurements
    measure_1 = measure("{asdf1234}")
    measure_2 = measure("{hjkl5678}")
    if None not in [measure_1, measure_2]:
        if measure_1 < 20 and measure_2 > 10:
            run_action("{qwer1234}")
            run_action("{uiop5678}")

    # Example 3, test two measurements and sum of measurements
    measure_1 = measure("{asdf1234}")
    measure_2 = measure("{hjkl5678}")
    if None not in [measure_1, measure_2]:
        sum = measure_1 + measure_2
        if measure_1 > 2 and 10 < measure_2 < 23 and sum < 30.5:
            run_action("{qwer1234}")
        else:
            run_action("{uiop5678}")

    # Example 4, combine into one conditional
    measurement = measure("{asdf1234}")
    if measurement != None and 20 < measurement < 30:
        run_action("{uiop5678}")

    # Example 5, test two measurements and convert Edge Input from 0 or 1 to True or False
    measure_1 = measure("{asdf1234}")
    measure_2 = measure("{hjkl5678}")
    if None not in [measure_1, measure_2]:
        if bool(measure_1) and measure_2 > 10:
            run_all_actions()

    # Example 6, test measurement with "or" and a rounded measurement
    measure_1 = measure("{asdf1234}")
    measure_2 = measure("{hjkl5678}")
    if None not in [measure_1, measure_2]:
        if measure_1 > 20 or int(round(measure_2)) in [20, 21, 22]:
            run_action("{qwer1234}")
            if measure_1 > 30:
                run_action("{uiop5678}")


If your action is a type that receives a message (E-Mail or Note), you can
modify this message to include extra information before it is added to the
Note or E-Mail. To do this, append a string to the variable ``message`` and
add this to the ``message`` parameter of run_action() or run_all_actions().
Below are some examples. Note the use of "+=" instead of "=", which
appends the string to the variable ``message``.

::

    # Example 1
    measurement = measure("{asdf1234}")
    if measurement is None and measurement > 23:
        message += "Measurement was {}".format(measurement)
        run_action("{uiop5678}", message=message)

    # Example 2
    measure_1 = measure("{asdf1234}")
    measure_2 = measure("{hjkl5678}")
    if None not in [measure_1, measure_2]:
        if measure_1 < 20 and measure_2 > 10:
            message += "Measurement 1: {m1}, Measurement 2: {m2}".format(m1=measure_1, m2=measure_2)
            run_all_actions(message=message)


Before activating any conditionals, it's advised to thoroughly explore all
possible scenarios and plan a configuration that eliminates conflicts. Some
devices or outputs may respond atypically or fail when switched on and off in
rapid succession. Therefore, trial run your configuration before connecting
devices to any outputs.

+-----------------------+-------------------------------------------------+

Timer (Daily Time Span) Options
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

Run a timer that triggers Conditional Actions at a specific period if it's
between the set start and end times. For example, if the Start Time is set
to 10:00 and End Time set to 11:00 and Period set to 120 seconds, the
Conditional Actions will trigger every 120 seconds when the time is between
10 AM and 11 AM.

This may be useful, for instance, if you desire an Output to remain on during
a particular time period and you want to prevent power outages from interrupting
the cycle (which a simple Time Point Timer could not prevent against because
it only triggers once at the Start Time). By setting an Output to turn the
lights on every few minutes during the Start -> End period, it ensured the
Output remains on during this period.

Methods
-------

``Setup -> Method``

Methods enable Setpoint Tracking in PIDs and time-based duty cycle
changes in timers. Normally, a PID controller will regulate an
environmental condition to a specific setpoint. If you would like the
setpoint to change over time, this is called setpoint tracking. Setpoint
Tracking is useful for applications such as reflow ovens, thermal
cyclers (DNA replication), mimicking natural daily cycles, and more.
Methods may also be used to change a duty cycle over time when used with
a Run PWM Method Conditional.

Universal Options
`````````````````

These options are shared with several method types.

+-------------------+-------------------------------------------------------+
| Setting           | Description                                           |
+===================+=======================================================+
| Start Time/Date   | This is the start time of a range of time.            |
+-------------------+-------------------------------------------------------+
| End Time/Date     | This is the end time of a range of time.              |
+-------------------+-------------------------------------------------------+
| Start Setpoint    | This is the start setpoint of a range of setpoints.   |
+-------------------+-------------------------------------------------------+
| End Setpoint      | This is the end setpoint of a range of setpoints.     |
+-------------------+-------------------------------------------------------+

Specific Method Options
```````````````````````

Time/Date Method
''''''''''''''''

A time/date method allows a specific time/date span to dictate the
setpoint. This is useful for long-running methods, that may take place
over the period of days, weeks, or months.

Duration Method
'''''''''''''''

A Duration Method allows a ***Setpoint*** (for PIDs) or ***Duty Cycle***
(for Conditional) to be set after specific durations of time. Each new
duration added will stack, meaning it will come after the previous
duration, meaning a newly-added ***Start Setpoint*** will begin after
the previous entry's ***End Setpoint***.

If the "Repeat Method" option is used, this will cause the method to
repeat once it has reached the end. If this option is used, no more
durations may be added to the method. If the repeat option is deleted
then more durations may be added. For instance, if your method is 200
seconds total, if the Repeat Duration is set to 600 seconds, the method
will repeat 3 times and then automatically turn off the PID or Conditional.

Daily (Time-Based) Method
'''''''''''''''''''''''''

The daily time-based method is similar to the time/date method, however
it will repeat every day. Therefore, it is essential that only the span
of one day be set in this method. Begin with the start time at 00:00:00
and end at 23:59:59 (or 00:00:00, which would be 24 hours from the
start). The start time must be equal or greater than the previous end
time.

Daily (Sine Wave) Method
''''''''''''''''''''''''

The daily sine wave method defines the setpoint over the day based on a
sinusoidal wave. The sine wave is defined by y = [A \* sin(B \* x + C)]
+ D, where A is amplitude, B is frequency, C is the angle shift, and D
is the y-axis shift. This method will repeat daily.

Daily (Bezier Curve) Method
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''

A daily Bezier curve method define the setpoint over the day based on a
cubic Bezier curve. If unfamiliar with a Bezier curve, it is recommended
you use the
`graphical Bezier curve generator <https://www.desmos.com/calculator/cahqdxeshd>`__
and use the
8 variables it creates for 4 points (each a set of x and y). The x-axis
start (x3) and end (x0) will be automatically stretched or skewed to fit
within a 24-hour period and this method will repeat daily.

PID Tuning
==========

``Function -> PIDs``

PID Control Theory
------------------

The PID controller is the most common regulatory controller found in
industrial settings, for it"s ability to handle both simple and complex
regulation. The PID controller has three paths, the proportional,
integral, and derivative.

The **P**\ roportional takes the error and multiplies it by the constant
K\ :sub:`p`, to yield an output value. When the error is large, there
will be a large proportional output.

The **I**\ ntegral takes the error and multiplies it by K\ :sub:`i`,
then integrates it (K:sub:`i` Â· 1/s). As the error changes over time,
the integral will continually sum it and multiply it by the constant
K\ :sub:`i`. The integral is used to remove perpetual error in the
control system. If using K\ :sub:`p` alone produces an output that
produces a perpetual error (i.e. if the sensor measurement never reaches
the Set Point), the integral will increase the output until the error
decreases and the Set Point is reached.

The **D**\ erivative multiplies the error by K\ :sub:`d`, then
differentiates it (K:sub:`d` Â· s). When the error rate changes over
time, the output signal will change. The faster the change in error, the
larger the derivative path becomes, decreasing the output rate of
change. This has the effect of dampening overshoot and undershoot
(oscillation) of the Set Point.

--------------

Using temperature as an example, the Process Variable (PV) is the
measured temperature, the Setpoint (SP) is the desired temperature, and
the Error (e) is the distance between the measured temperature and the
desired temperature (indicating if the actual temperature is too hot or
too cold and to what degree). The error is manipulated by each of the
three PID components, producing an output, called the Manipulated
Variable (MV) or Control Variable (CV). To allow control of how much
each path contributes to the output value, each path is multiplied by a
gain (represented by *K\ :sub:`P`*, *K\ :sub:`I`*, and *K\ :sub:`D`*).
By adjusting the gains, the sensitivity of the system to each path is
affected. When all three paths are summed, the PID output is produced.
If a gain is set to 0, that path does not contribute to the output and
that path is essentially turned off.

The output can be used a number of ways, however this controller was
designed to use the output to affect the measured value (PV). This
feedback loop, with a *properly tuned* PID controller, can achieve a set
point in a short period of time, maintain regulation with little
oscillation, and respond quickly to disturbance.

Therefor, if one would be regulating temperature, the sensor would be a
temperature sensor and the feedback device(s) would be able to heat and
cool. If the temperature is lower than the Set Point, the output value
would be positive and a heater would activate. The temperature would
rise toward the desired temperature, causing the error to decrease and a
lower output to be produced. This feedback loop would continue until the
error reaches 0 (at which point the output would be 0). If the
temperature continues to rise past the Set Point (this is may be
acceptable, depending on the degree), the PID would produce a negative
output, which could be used by the cooling device to bring the
temperature back down, to reduce the error. If the temperature would
normally lower without the aid of a cooling device, then the system can
be simplified by omitting a cooler and allowing it to lower on its own.

Implementing a controller that effectively utilizes *K\ :sub:`P`*,
*K\ :sub:`I`*, and *K\ :sub:`D`* can be challenging. Furthermore, it is
often unnecessary. For instance, the *K\ :sub:`I`* and *K\ :sub:`D`* can
be set to 0, effectively turning them off and producing the very popular
and simple P controller. Also popular is the PI controller. It is
recommended to start with only *K\ :sub:`P`* activated, then experiment
with *K\ :sub:`P`* and *K\ :sub:`I`*, before finally using all three.
Because systems will vary (e.g. airspace volume, degree of insulation,
and the degree of impact from the connected device, etc.), each path
will need to be adjusted through experimentation to produce an effective
output.

Quick Setup Examples
--------------------

These example setups are meant to illustrate how to configure regulation
in particular directions, and not to achieve ideal values to configure
your *K\ :sub:`P`*, *K\ :sub:`I`*, and *K\ :sub:`D`* gains. There are a
number of online resources that discuss techniques and methods that have
been developed to determine ideal PID values (such as
`here <http://robotics.stackexchange.com/questions/167/what-are-good-strategies-for-tuning-pid-loops>`__,
`here <http://innovativecontrols.com/blog/basics-tuning-pid-loops>`__,
`here <https://hennulat.wordpress.com/2011/01/12/pid-loop-tuning-101/>`__,
`here <http://eas.uccs.edu/wang/ECE4330F12/PID-without-a-PhD.pdf>`__,
and `here <http://www.atmel.com/Images/doc2558.pdf>`__) and since there
are no universal values that will work for every system, it is
recommended to conduct your own research to understand the variables and
essential to conduct your own experiments to effectively implement them.

Provided merely as an example of the variance of PID values, one of my
setups had temperature PID values (up regulation) of *K\ :sub:`P`* = 30,
*K\ :sub:`I`* = 1.0, and *K\ :sub:`D`* = 0.5, and humidity PID values
(up regulation) of *K\ :sub:`P`* = 1.0, *K\ :sub:`I`* = 0.2, and
*K\ :sub:`D`* = 0.5. Furthermore, these values may not have been optimal
but they worked well for the conditions of my environmental chamber.

Exact Temperature Regulation
----------------------------

This will set up the system to raise and lower the temperature to a
certain level with two regulatory devices (one that heats and one that
cools).

Add a sensor, then save the proper device and pin/address for each
sensor and activate the sensor.

Add two outputs, then save each GPIO and On Trigger state.

Add a PID, then select the newly-created sensor. Change *Setpoint* to
the desired temperature, *Regulate Direction* to "Both". Set *Raise
Output* to the relay attached to the heating device and the *Lower
Relay* to the relay attached to the cooling device.

Set *K\ :sub:`P`* = 1, *K\ :sub:`I`* = 0, and *K\ :sub:`D`* = 0, then
activate the PID.

If the temperature is lower than the Set Point, the heater should
activate at some interval determined by the PID controller until the
temperature rises to the set point. If the temperature goes higher than
the Set Point (or Set Point + Buffer), the cooling device will activate
until the temperature returns to the set point. If the temperature is
not reaching the Set Point after a reasonable amount of time, increase
the *K\ :sub:`P`* value and see how that affects the system. Experiment
with different configurations involving only *Read Interval* and
*K\ :sub:`P`* to achieve a good regulation. Avoid changing the
*K\ :sub:`I`* and *K\ :sub:`D`* from 0 until a working regulation is
achieved with *K\ :sub:`P`* alone.

View graphs in the 6 to 12 hour time span to identify how well the
temperature is regulated to the Setpoint. What is meant by
well-regulated will vary, depending on your specific application and
tolerances. Most applications of a PID controller would like to see the
proper temperature attained within a reasonable amount of time and with
little oscillation around the Setpoint.

Once regulation is achieved, experiment by reducing *K\ :sub:`P`*
slightly (~25%) and increasing *K\ :sub:`I`* by a low amount to start,
such as 0.1 (or lower, 0.01), then start the PID and observe how well
the controller regulates. Slowly increase *K\ :sub:`I`* until regulation
becomes both quick and with little oscillation. At this point, you
should be fairly familiar with experimenting with the system and the
*K\ :sub:`D`* value can be experimented with once both *K\ :sub:`P`* and
*K\ :sub:`I`* have been tuned.

High Temperature Regulation
---------------------------

Often the system can be simplified if two-way regulation is not needed.
For instance, if cooling is unnecessary, this can be removed from the
system and only up-regulation can be used.

Use the same configuration as the
`Exact Temperature Regulation <#exact-temperature-regulation>`__
example, except change *Regulate Direction* to "Raise" and do not touch
the "Down Relay" section.

In order to calculate accurate energy usage statistics, a few
characteristics of your electrical system needs to be know. These
variables should describe the characteristics of the electrical system
being used by the relays to operate electrical devices. Note: Proper
energy usage calculations also rely on the correct current draw to be
set for each output (see `Output Settings <#output>`__).

``[Gear Icon] -> Configure -> Measurements``

New measurements, units, and conversions can be created that can extend
functionality of Mycodo beyond the built-in types and equations. Be sure
to create units before measurements, as units need to be selected when
creating a measurement. A measurement can be created that already exists,
allowing additional units to be added to a pre-existing measurement. For
example, the measurement 'altitude' already exists, however if you wanted
to add the unit 'fathom', first create the unit 'fathom', then create the
measurement 'altitude' with the 'fathom' unit selected. It is okay to create
a custom measurement for a measurement that already exist (this is how new
units for a currently-installed measurement is added).

``[Gear Icon] -> Configure -> Users``

Mycodo requires at least one Admin user for the login system to be
enabled. If there isn't an Admin user, the web server will redirect to
an Admin Creation Form. This is the first page you see when starting
Mycodo for the first time. After an Admin user has been created,
additional users may be created from the User Settings page.

Camera Settings
---------------

``[Gear Icon] -> Configure -> Camera``

Many cameras can be used simultaneously with Mycodo. Each camera needs
to be set up in the camera settings, then may be used throughout the
software. Note that not every option (such as Hue or White Balance) may
be able to be used with your particular camera, due to manufacturer
differences in hardware and software.

+-----------------------+-------------------------------------------------+

Diagnostic Settings
-------------------

``[Gear Icon] -> Configure -> Diagnostics``

Sometimes issues arise in the system as a result of incompatible
configurations, either the result of a misconfigured part of the system
(Input, Output, etc.) or an update that didn't properly handle a database
upgrade, or other unforeseen issue. Sometimes it is necessary to perform
diagnostic actions that can determine the cause of the issue or fix the
issue itself. The options below are meant to alleviate issues, such as a
misconfigured dashboard element causing an error on the ``Dash`` page,
which may cause an inability to access the ``Dash`` page to correct the
issue. Deleting all Dashboard Elements may be the most economical method
to enable access to the ``Dash`` page again, at the cost of having to
readd all the Dashboard Elements that were once there.

Miscellaneous
=============

Create an Input Module
----------------------

***This section is a work-in-progress***

If you have a sensor that is not currently supported by Mycodo, you can build your own input module and import it into Mycodo. All information about an input is contained within the input module, set in the dictionary 'INPUT_INFORMATION'. Each module will requires at a minimum for these variables to be set: 'input_name_unique', 'input_manufacturer', 'input_name', 'measurements_name', and 'measurements_dict'.

Open any of the built-in modules located in the inputs directory (https://github.com/kizniche/Mycodo/tree/master/mycodo/inputs/) for examples of the proper formatting.

There's also minimal input module template that generates random data as an example:

https://github.com/kizniche/Mycodo/tree/master/mycodo/inputs/examples/minimal_humidity_temperature.py

The following link provides the full list of available INPUT_INFORMATION options along with descriptions:

The dashboard is where you can add pieces of data for easy viewing. It
is highly customizable and provides an easy way to see exactly what data
you want to see on one screen.

Graphs
``````

A graphical data display that is useful for viewing data sets spanning
relatively short periods of time (hours/days/weeks). Select a time frame
to view data and continually updating data from new sensor measurements.
Multiple graphs can be created on one page that enables a dashboard to
be created of graphed sensor data. Each graph may have one or more data
from inputs, outputs, or PIDs rendered onto it. To edit graph options,
select the plus sign on the top-right of a graph.

Live Measurements
-----------------

``Live``

The ``Live`` page is the first page a user sees after logging
in to Mycodo. It will display the current measurements being acquired
from Input and Math controllers. If there is nothing displayed on the
``Live`` page, ensure an Input or Math controller is both
configured correctly and activated. Data will be automatically updated
on the page from the measurement database.

Asynchronous Graphs
-------------------

``Async``

A graphical data display that is useful for viewing data sets spanning
relatively long periods of time (weeks/months/years), which could be
very data- and processor-intensive to view as a Live Graph. Select a
time frame and data will be loaded from that time span, if it exists.
The first view will be of the entire selected data set. For every
view/zoom, 700 data points will be loaded. If there are more than 700
data points recorded for the time span selected, 700 points will be
created from an averaging of the points in that time span. This enables
much less data to be used to navigate a large data set. For instance, 4
months of data may be 10 megabytes if all of it were downloaded.
However, when viewing a 4 month span, it's not possible to see every
data point of that 10 megabytes, and aggregating of points is
inevitable. With asynchronous loading of data, you only download what
you see. So, instead of downloading 10 megabytes every graph load, only
~50kb will be downloaded until a new zoom level is selected, at which
time only another ~50kb is downloaded.

Note: Live Graphs require measurements to be acquired, therefore at
least one sensor needs to be added and activated in order to display
live data.

Notes
-----

``More -> Notes``

Notes may be created that can then be displayed on graphs or referenced at a later time. All notes are timestamped with the date/time of creation or may be created with a custom date/time. Each note must have at least one tag selected. Tags are what are selected to be displayed on a graph and all notes with that tag will appear in the time frame selected on the graph.

+-----------------------+-------------------------------------------------+

Export-Import
-------------

``More -> Export Import``

Measurements that fall within the selected date/time frame may be
exported as CSV with their corresponding timestamps.

Additionally, the entire measurement database (influxdb) may be exported
as a ZIP archive backup. This ZIP may be imported back in any Mycodo system
to restore these measurements. Note that an import will override the
current data (i.e. destroying it).

Mycodo settings may be exported as a ZIP file containing the Mycodo
settings database (sqlite). This ZIP file may be used to restore the
settings database to another Mycodo install, as long as the Mycodo
version and database versions are the same. Future support for
installing older (or newer) databases and performing an automatic
upgrade/downgrade is in the works.

Dependencies
------------

``[Gear Icon] -> Dependencies``

The dependency page allows viewing of dependency information and the
ability to initiate their installation.

During the installation of Mycodo, there is an option to select which
dependencies to install. If "Minimal Install" or "Custom Install" was
selected (rather than "Full Install"), there may be unmet dependencies
on your system. Don't worry, this isn't necessarily a problem. These
optional dependencies only need to be installed when there's a
particular feature you want to use. When a user attempts to use a
feature that has an unmet dependency, the user will be forwarded to the
Dependency page in order to install it.

Camera
------

``Cam``

Once a cameras has been set up (in the
`Camera Settings <#camera-settings>`__), it may be used to capture still images,
create time-lapses, and stream video. Cameras may also be used by
`Conditional Statements <#conditional-statements>`__ to trigger a camera
image or video capture (as well as the ability to email the image/video
with a notification).

Energy Usage
------------

``More -> Energy Usage``

There are two methods for calculating energy usage. The first relies on
determining how long Outputs have been on. Based on this, if the number
of Amps the output draws has been set in the output Settings, then the
kWh and cost can be calculated. Discovering the number of amps the
device draws can be accomplished by calculating this from the output
typically given as watts on the device label, or with the use of a
current clamp while the device is operating. The limitation of this
method is PWM Outputs are not currently used to calculate these figures
due to the difficulty determining the current consumption of devices
driven by PWM signals.

The second method for calculating energy consumption is more accurate and
is the recommended method if you desire the most accurate estimation
of energy consumption and cost. This method relies on an Input or Math
measuring Amps. One way to do this is with the used of an analog-to-digital
converter (ADC) that converts the voltage output from a transformer into
current (Amps). One wire from the AC line that powers your device(s) passes
thorough the transformer and the device converts the current that passes
through that wire into a voltage that corresponds to the amperage. For
instance, the below sensor converts 0 - 50 amps input to 0 - 5 volts output.
An ADC receives this output as its input. One would set this conversion
range in Mycodo and the calculated amperage will be stored. On the Energy
Usage page, add this ADC Input measurement and a report summary will be
generated. Keep in mind that for a particular period (for example, the past
week) to be accurate, there needs to be a constant measurement of amps at a
periodic rate. The faster the rate the more accurate the calculation will
be. This is due to the amperage measurements being averaged for this period
prior to calculating kWh and cost. If there is any time turing this period
where amp measurements aren't being acquired when in fact there are devices
consuming current, the calculation is likely to not be accurate.

Backup-Restore
--------------

``[Gear Icon] -> Backup Restore``

A backup is made to /var/Mycodo-backups when the system is upgraded or
through the web interface on the ``[Gear Icon] -> Backup Restore`` page.

If you need to restore a backup, this can be done on the
``[Gear Icon] -> Backup  Restore``
page. Find the backup you would like restored and press
the Restore button beside it. A restore can also be initialized through
the command line. Use the following commands to initialize a restore,
changing the appropriate directory names, 'user' to your user name, and
TIME and COMMIT to the appropriate text found as the directory names in
/var/Mycodo-backups/

::

    sudo mv /home/user/Mycodo /home/user/Mycodo_old
    sudo cp -a /var/Mycodo-backups/Mycodo-TIME-COMMIT /home/user/Mycodo
    sudo /bin/bash ~/Mycodo/mycodo/scripts/upgrade_post.sh

USB Device Persistence Across Reboots
-------------------------------------

From `(#547) Theoi-Meteoroi on Github <https://github.com/kizniche/Mycodo/issues/547#issuecomment-428752904>`__:

Using USB devices, such as USB-to-serial interfaces to connect a sensor,
while convenient, poses an issue if there are multiple devices when the
system reboots. After a reboot, there is no guarantee the device will
persist with the same name. For instance, if Sensor A is /dev/ttyUSB0
and Sensor B is /dev/ttyUSB1, after a reboot Sensor A may be /dev/ttyUSB1
and Sensor B may be /dev/ttyUSB0. This will cause Mycodo to query the
wrong device for a measurement, potentially causing a mis-measurement,
or worse, an incorrect measurement because the response is not from the
correct sensor (I've seen my temperature sensor read 700+ degrees celsius
because of this!). Follow the instructions below to alleviate this issue.

I use udev to create a persistent device name ('/dev/dust-sensor') that
will be linked to the /dev/ttyUSBn that is chosen at device arrival in
the kernel. The only requirement is some attribute returned from the USB
device that is unique. The common circumstance is that none of the
attributes are unique and you get stuck with just VID and PID, which is
ok as long as you don't have any other adapters that report the same VID
and PID. If you have multiple adapters with the same VID and PID, then
hopefully they have some unique attribute. This command will walk the
attributes. Run on each USB device and then compare differences to
possibly find some attribute to use.

``udevadm info --name=/dev/ttyUSB0 --attribute-walk``

I ended up using the serial number on the ZH03B to program the USB adapter
serial field. This way guarantees unique serial numbers rather than me
trying to remember what was the last serial number I used to increment
by 1.

When you plug a USB device in it can be enumerated to different device
names by the operating system. To fix this problem for this sensor on
linux, I changed attributes that make the connection unique.

First - find the VID and PID for the USB device:

::

    pi@raspberry:~ $ lsusb
    Bus 001 Device 008: ID 10c4:ea60 Cygnal Integrated Products, Inc. CP210x UART Bridge / myAVR mySmartUSB light
    Bus 001 Device 003: ID 0424:ec00 Standard Microsystems Corp. SMSC9512/9514 Fast Ethernet Adapter
    Bus 001 Device 002: ID 0424:9514 Standard Microsystems Corp. SMC9514 Hub
    Bus 001 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0002 Linux Foundation 2.0 root hub

In this case the Vendor ID is 10c4 The Product ID is ea60

Since I changed the serial number field - this will be unique.

::

    pi@raspberry:~ $ udevadm info --name=/dev/ttyUSB0 --attribute-walk | grep serial
    SUBSYSTEMS=="usb-serial"
    ATTRS{serial}=="ZH03B180904"
    ATTRS{serial}=="3f980000.usb"

Now I have an attribute to tell udev what to do. I create a file in /etc/udev/rules.d with a name like "99-dustsensor.rules". In that file I tell udev what device name to create when it sees this device plugged in:

``SUBSYSTEM=="tty", ATTRS{idVendor}=="10c4", ATTRS{idProduct}=="ea60", ATTRS{serial}=="ZH03B180904" SYMLINK+="dust-sensor"``

To test the new rule:

::

    pi@raspberry:/dev $ sudo udevadm trigger
    pi@raspberry:/dev $ ls -al dust-sensor
    lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 7 Oct 6 21:04 dust-sensor -> ttyUSB0

Now, every time the dust sensor is plugged in, it shows up at /dev/dust-sensor

Troubleshooting
===============

Daemon Not Running
------------------

-  Check the Logs: From the ``[Gear Icon] -> Mycodo Logs``
   page, check the Daemon Log for any errors. If the issue began after
   an upgrade, also check the Upgrade Log for indications of an issue.
-  Determine if the Daemon is Running: Execute
   ``ps aux | grep '/var/mycodo-root/env/bin/python /var/mycodo-root/mycodo/mycodo_daemon.py'``
   in a terminal and look for an entry to be returned. If nothing is
   returned, the daemon is not running.
-  Daemon Lock File: If the daemon is not running, make sure the daemon
   lock file is deleted at ``/var/lock/mycodo.pid``. The daemon cannot
   start if the lock file is present.
-  If a solution could not be found after investigating the above
   suggestions, submit a
   `New Mycodo Issue <https://github.com/kizniche/Mycodo/issues/new>`__
   on github.

Incorrect Database Version
--------------------------

-  Check the ``[Gear Icon] -> System Information`` page or select the
   mycodo logo in the top-left.
-  An incorrect database version error means the version stored in the
   Mycodo settings database (``~/Mycodo/databases/mycodo.db``) is not
   correct for the latest version of Mycodo, determined in the Mycodo
   config file (``~/Mycodo/mycodo/config.py``).
-  This can be caused by an error in the upgrade process from an older
   database version to a newer version, or from a database that did not
   upgrade during the Mycodo upgrade process.
-  Check the Upgrade Log for any issues that may have occurred. The log
   is located at ``/var/log/mycodo/mycodoupgrade.log`` but may also be
   accessed from the web UI (if you're able to): select [Gear Icon] ->
   Mycodo Logs -> Upgrade Log.
-  Sometimes issues may not immediately present themselves. It is not
   uncommon to be experiencing a database issue that was actually
   introduced several Mycodo versions ago, before the latest upgrade.
-  Because of the nature of how many versions the database can be in,
   correcting a database issue may be very difficult. It may be much
   easier to delete your database and let Mycodo generate a new one.
-  Use the following commands to rename your database and restart the
   web UI. If both commands are successful, refresh your web UI page in
   your browser in order to generate a new database and create a new
   Admin user.

Devices
=======

All Input and Output devices are listed below.

The I2C interface should be enabled with ``raspi-config``.

The 1-wire interface should be configured with `these
instructions <https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruits-raspberry-pi-lesson-11-ds18b20-temperature-sensing>`__.

`This
documentation <http://www.co2meters.com/Documentation/AppNotes/AN137-Raspberry-Pi.zip>`__
provides specific installation procedures for configuring UART with the
Raspberry Pi version 1 or 2.

The K30 may be tested by executing
``~/Mycodo/mycodo/tests/manual_tests/test_uart_K30.py``

For Atlas Scientific sensors, `this
guide <https://www.atlas-scientific.com/_files/code/pi_sample_code.pdf>`__
may be used, as well as the above K-30 guide, to set up UART on the
Raspberry Pi 1 and 2. However, for Pi 3s, use the procedure below.

Because the UART is handled differently by the Raspberry Pi 3, from of
the addition of bluetooth, there are a different set of instructions. If
installing Mycodo on a Raspberry Pi 3, you only need to perform these
steps to configure UART:

Run raspi-config

``sudo raspi-config``

Go to ``Advanced Options`` -> ``Serial`` and disable. Then edit
``/boot/config.txt``

``sudo vi /boot/config.txt``

Find the line "enable\_uart=0" and change it to "enable\_uart=1", then
reboot.

Edge Detection
--------------

The detection of a changing signal, for instance a simple switch
completing a circuit, requires the use of edge detection. By detecting a
rising edge (LOW to HIGH), a falling edge (HIGH to LOW), or both,
actions or events can be triggered. The GPIO chosen to detect the signal
should be equipped with an appropriate resistor that either pulls the
GPIO up [to 5-volts] or down [to ground]. The option to enable the
internal pull-up or pull-down resistors is not available for safety
reasons. Use your own resistor to pull the GPIO high or low.

Examples of devices that can be used with edge detection: simple
switches and buttons, PIR motion sensors, reed switches, hall effect
sensors, float switches, and more.

I2C Multiplexers
----------------

All devices that connected to the Raspberry Pi by the I2C bus need to
have a unique address in order to communicate. Some inputs may have the
same address (such as the AM2315), which prevents more than one from
being connected at the same time. Others may provide the ability to
change the address, however the address range may be limited, which
limits by how many you can use at the same time. I2C multiplexers are
extremely clever and useful in these scenarios because they allow
multiple sensors with the same I2C address to be connected.

Multiplexers can be set up by loading a kernel driver to handle the
communication, producing a new I2C bus device for each multiplexer
channel. To enable the driver for the TCA9548A/PCA9548A, visit
`GPIO-pca9548 <https://github.com/Theoi-Meteoroi/GPIO-pca9548>`__ to get
the code and latest install instructions. If successfully set up, there
will be 8 new I2C buses on the ``[Gear Icon] -> System Information`` page.

The driver for the TCA9545A can be found at
https://github.com/camrex/i2c-mux-pca9545a and other drivers are available
elsewhere. See the manufacturer or user forums for details. Some
multiplexers I've tested are below.

    TCA9548A/PCA9548A: I2C Multiplexer
    `link <https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-tca9548a-1-to-8-i2c-multiplexer-breakout/overview>`__
    (I2C): Has 8 selectable addresses, so 8 multiplexers can be
    connected to one Raspberry Pi. Each multiplexer has 8 channels,
    allowing up to 8 devices/sensors with the same address to be
    connected to each multiplexer. 8 multiplexers x 8 channels = 64
    devices/sensors with the same I2C address.

    `link <http://store.switchdoc.com/i2c-4-channel-mux-extender-expander-board-grove-pin-headers-for-arduino-and-raspberry-pi/>`__
    (I2C): This board also creates 4 new I2C buses, but each with their
    own selectable voltage, either 3.3 or 5.0 volts.

Analog-to-Digital Converters
----------------------------

An analog to digital converter (ADC) allows the use of any analog sensor
that outputs a variable voltage. A `voltage
divider <https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/voltage-dividers>`__ may
be necessary to attain your desired range.

Notes
'''''

From
`@Theoi-Meteoroi <https://github.com/kizniche/Mycodo/issues/315#issuecomment-344798815>`__
on GitHub:

I figured out why this [AM2315] sensor is unreliable with Rpi3 hardware
I2C. It is among a number of I2C devices that really hates the BCM2835
clock stretching blunder (hardware bug:
`raspberrypi/linux#254 <https://github.com/raspberrypi/linux/issues/254>`__).
The wakeup attempts fail, consistently. I checked the bitstream with a
sniffer, and see that the sensor may respond once out of 20 or so tries
(or not at all) but only with a single byte returned. The solution is to
use a software implementation of the I2C bus. You need to add pull-up
resistors (4.7k is dandy) to 3.3v and install the i2c\_gpio device
overlay. Seems to work fine now, will run for a few days, but the CRC
failures are gone and I get good readings, every time. And no twiddling
the power for the sensor is required.

To enable software I2C, add the following line to your
``/boot/config.txt``

``dtoverlay=i2c-gpio,i2c_gpio_sda=23,i2c_gpio_scl=24,i2c_gpio_delay_us=4``

After rebooting, a new I2C bus at /dev/i2c-3 should exist with SDA on
pin 23 (BCM) and SCL on pin 24 (BCM). Make sure you add the appropriate
pull-up resistors before connecting any devices.

TSL2561
```````

The TSL2561 Luminosity Sensor is a sophisticated light sensor which has
a flat response across most of the visible spectrum. Unlike simpler
sensors, the TSL2561 measures both infrared and visible light to better
approximate the response of the human eye. And because the TSL2561 is an
integrating sensor (it soaks up light for a predetermined amount of
time), it is capable of measuring both small and large amounts of light
by changing the integration time.
